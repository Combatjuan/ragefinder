Analyze a source tree by words that indicate programmer rage.  An impractical bash script.

FAQ:

*Why did you write this?*
I needed a project that fit the following constraints:
 1.) It could be reasonably completed in an hour and a half.
 2.) It could serve as a vehicle for me to learn more about bash and shell scripting generally.
 3.) It would be amusing.
 4.) I could come up with the project in 10m or less.
This project is the result of my demented heuristics run against that constraint satisfaction problem.

*In Bash?*
Yeah.  Because the whole point was to work on something that would broaden my bash skills.  And this seems like it's actually a pretty good project for that.

*Why didn't you include <insert profane word here>?*
I'm afraid I'm just not that good at swearing.  I probably didn't think of your clever word.  From what I can tell, quality profanity takes practice.

*This offense me*
Hmmm...  Ok.  Welcome to the internet!  You're going to hate it here.
